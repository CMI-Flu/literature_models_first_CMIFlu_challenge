## The implementation of the prediction methods presented in the study by Qui et al. 2018

An analysis of the differential expression between HBV vaccine responders and non-responders allowed for the identification of 55 up- and 15 down regulated transcripts before vaccination in the study by Qui et al. 2018. This was deemed a relevant transcriptional signature, which had the potential for being predictive of the vaccine response. The original study did not present a quantification of the differentially expressed genes and hence there was no expected directionality of the prediction method either. The gene set score was used for quantifying the transcriptional signature. The Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 was utilized in the original study. By using the BioMart R package (biomaRt) to connect to the Ensembl database, we retrieved a table for mapping between probe IDs and Ensembl IDs. Using the mapping it was only possible to identify 34 (25 up- and 9 downregulated) Ensemble IDs in the CMI-PB gene expression datasets out of the 70 probe IDs presented in the original differential genomic signature.
