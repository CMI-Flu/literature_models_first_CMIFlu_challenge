## The data from the CMI-PB project

As the data files are too large to be stored on GitHub, these have to be downloaded. Scripts for downloading and preprocessing the datafiles is provided here. 

### Step 1: 

- Make the download_from_webpage_links.sh script executable (e.g. chmod 755 download_from_webpage_links.sh).
- Run the download_from_webpage_links.sh file in the working directory (./download_from_webpage_links.sh on the command line)

### Step 2:

- Open Jupyter notebook (in the terminal jupyter notebook) and navigate to the working directory and open Standardize_data.ipynb.
- Run the code in Standardize_data.ipynb.
