## The implementation of the prediction methods presented in the study by Tsang et al. 2014

Tsang et al. 2014 presented diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLDA) models using a varying number of cell populations to predict the antibody response induced by the 2009 seasonal and pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) vaccines. A total of 126 cell subpopulations were examined in the flow cytometric analysis in the study and DLDA models using respectively top 2, 5, 10, and 30 predictive cell subsets were evaluated. In the CMI-PB datasets respectively 25 and 41 cell populations were characterized in 2020 and 2021, and thus it was only deemed reasonable to evaluate the models using 2 and 5 cell populations. As gating strategies differed, the cell populations closest to the ones reported in the original study, were selected manually in the CMI-PB datasets. Preprocessing of the cell populations frequencies was performed as in the original study, where zero values were first set to 0.01 and followingly the frequencies were log10-transformed. As the analysis for the original study was performed almost 10 years ago, it was not possible to obtain the original models. However, the authors kindly provided us with the original code, so we could replicate the analysis and thereby obtain the prediction models.
